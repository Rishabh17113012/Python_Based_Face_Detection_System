Python Based Face Detection System is a real-time face detection and recognition project built using Python, Flask, OpenCV, and Dlib. It provides a simple web interface that can detect and recognize faces from a live webcam feed or uploaded images. The system can be extended for use in attendance tracking, access control, or authentication-based applications.
This project uses Flask version 3.1.2 as the web framework, OpenCV version 4.9.0.80 for computer vision operations, Dlib version 19.24.6 and the face-recognition library version 1.3.0 for facial recognition, scikit-learn version 1.5.2 and joblib version 1.3.2 for machine learning utilities, and NumPy version 1.26.4 for numerical computations.
The main features of the system include real-time face detection using OpenCV and Dlib, face recognition using the face-recognition library, an easy-to-use Flask web interface, the ability to store and manage known faces for later identification, and a lightweight, modular backend built in Python.
To install the project, first clone the repository from GitHub using the command “git clone https://github.com/Rishabh17113012/Python_Based_Face_Detection_System.git” and navigate to the project directory. Then, create a virtual environment using “python -m venv venv” and activate it (on macOS/Linux use “source venv/bin/activate”, and on Windows use “venv\Scripts\activate”). Next, install all dependencies using “pip install -r requirements.txt”.
To run the application, start the Flask server by running “python app.py” in your terminal. Once it starts, open your web browser and visit “http://127.0.0.1:5000/” to access the web interface.
The project folder structure typically includes the main app.py file, static and templates folders for frontend assets and HTML pages, models and data directories for storing ML models and known face images, a requirements.txt file listing dependencies, and a README.md file for documentation.
Example use cases include facial recognition attendance systems, secure login or authentication, smart home access control, and real-time face detection demonstrations for learning AI and machine learning concepts.
